Provides an implementation of Archimate 3.0 modeling language for MetaEdit+ (www.metacase.com/download).

- .mec file includes the metamodel and example models
- .mxs file includes library symbols

After importing these two files you may apply Archimate 3.0. One objective for this implemenation is being able to integrate Archimate metamodel with other modeling languages, like BPMN related to processes, Class (e.g. of UML) related to data objects and elements of Archimate etc. Integrated metamodels provide then richer specification of architecture, code generation etc. Metamodel extensions can be done with MetaEdit+ Workbench.

Note that 3.0 implementation has errors as acknowledge by Archimate develoeprs and there will be later 2017 updated version.
