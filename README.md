Provides an implementation of Archimate 3.0 modeling language for MetaEdit+ (www.metacase.com/download).

- .mec file includes the metamodel and example models
- .mxs file includes library symbols

After importing these two files you may apply Archimate 3.0. One objective for this implemenation is being able to integrate Archimate metamodel with other modeling languages, like BPMN related to processes, Class diagrams (e.g. of UML) related to data objects and elements of Archimate etc. Integrated metamodels provide then richer specification of architecture as there is no need to update e.g. process or task description in many languages (e.g. name of data object in Archimate and of class in class diagram are the same). Additionally, reporting over integrated models, metrics, documentation, code generation etc. become possible. Metamodel extensions can be done with MetaEdit+ Workbench.

Note that ArchiMate 3.0 standard has tens of errors as acknowledge by Archimate developers and there will be later 2017 updated version.
